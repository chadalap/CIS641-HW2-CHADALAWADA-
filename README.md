# PRIYADARSHINI CHADALAWADA

- I like to workout
- I also enjoy going on treks
- At times I also like practicing SQL on leetcode (occasionally)

## Technical Background
I have worked as a Big Data developer for about 2 years with my area of expertise is SQL & Python. Last semester was also a good learning experience for me as I have developed my skillset in ETL and Google Cloud.
